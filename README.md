# MUN-Web-App

# About 
Full-Stack multi-user web application created for use in Model United Nations (MUN) conferences, in order to faciliate the exchange of resolutions between the various departments involved in the conference. 

# Usage 
Each user can log in using their credentials, or register to use the web application. After logging in, depending on their role (either a committee chair/president, editor or approval panel member), the user is redirected to one of three pages. 
Comittee heads can upload resolutions to be processed by the editors. 
Editors can download the resolutions sent by the committees, in which case the resolutions can no longer be downloaded by any other ediitor, to ensure that work is not being done twice. Editors can also upload edited resolutions for review by the approval panel. 
Aproval panel members can download edited resolutions to review their content and modify them until they meet the standards of the conference.
